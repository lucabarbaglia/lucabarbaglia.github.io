We use a loan-level data set of millions of residential mortgages originated between 2000 and 2013 to calculate regional indicators of household debt and property prices. The detailed information allows us to construct a measure of interest rate mispricing during the housing boom that we use to identify the effect of a credit shock on household debt. Our analysis provides three main conclusions. First, in the period 2004-2006 the measure of credit shock was negative in most European regions which indicates that credit conditions were significantly relaxed relative to earlier years. Second, we find that regions in which household leverage increased more rapidly during the 2004-2006 period experienced a more severe decline in output and employment after 2008. These results are consistent with the view that an aggregate credit supply shock in Europe boosted household leverage and house prices. Third, we find that the credit shock had the largest effect on increasing leverage for the low-income and the middle-income households, although the change in leverage of the middle-income households represents a more powerful predictor of the decline in economic activity.","tags":"","title":"Household Debt and Economic Growth in Europe","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Barbaglia","Consoli","Manzan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1705104000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1705104000,"objectID":"6718fc90ab7a088660f09b9835afe454","permalink":"https://lucabarbaglia.github.io/publication/2022_forecastingwitheconomicnews_eu/","publishdate":"2024-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_forecastingwitheconomicnews_eu/","section":"publication","summary":"We evaluate the informational content of news-based sentiment indicators for forecasting the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the five major European economies.

Our data set includes six large US newspapers, for a total of over 6.6 million articles and 4.2 billion words. Our findings suggest that several measures of economic sentiment track closely business cycle fluctuations and that they are relevant predictors for four major macroeconomic variables. The forecast accuracy increases significantly when economic sentiment is used in a time series model as these measures tend to proxy for the overall state of the economy. We also find that there are significant improvements in forecasting when sentiment is considered along with macroeconomic factors.

We adopt boosting algorithms from the machine learning literature and compare their performance relative to the logistic regression. With respect to the logistic benchmark, boosting models perform significantly better in providing predictions. The most important variables in explaining loan default are the interest rate currently applied to the mortgage and the local economic characteristics, while other loan- or borrower-specific features are less relevant.

Cutting-edge semantic techniques are now able to capture sentiments more accurately in various practical applications, including economic and financial forecasting. In particular, the extraction of sentiment from news text, social media and blogs for the prediction of economic and financial variables has attracted attention in recent years. Despite many successful applications of sentiment analysis (SA) in these domains, the range of semantic techniques employed is still limited and mostly focused on the detection of sentiment at a coarse-grained level, that is, whether the sentiment expressed by the entire text of a sentence is either positive or negative. This paper proposes a novel methodology for Fine-Grained Aspect-based Sentiment (FiGAS) analysis. The aim of the approach is to identify the sentiment associated to specific topics of interest in each sentence of a document and assigning real-valued polarity scores between -1 and +1 to those topics. The proposed approach is completely unsupervised and customized to the economic and financial domains by using a specialized lexicon make available along with the source code of FiGAS. Our lexicon-based SA approach relies on a detailed set of semantic polarity rules that allow understanding the origin of sentiment, in the spirit of the recent trend on Interpretable AI. We provide an in-depth comparison of the performance of the FiGAS algorithm relative to other popular lexicon-based SA approaches in predicting a humanly annotated data set in the economic and financial domains. Our results indicate that FiGAS statistically outperforms the other methods by providing a sentiment score that is closer to one of the human annotators.","tags":"","title":"Fine-Grained, Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis on Economic and Financial Lexicon","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Barbaglia","Croux","Wilms"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"c7b7305388684dd243abd1c4f1384732","permalink":"https://lucabarbaglia.github.io/publication/2022_antidumping/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_antidumping/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite the increasing integration of the global economic system, anti-dumping measures are a common tool used by governments to protect their national economy.

A recent trend is to extract information from news as an additional source to forecast economic activity and financial variables. The goal is to evaluate if news can improve forecasts from standard methods that usually are not well-specified and have poor out-of-sample performance. In a currently on-going project, our goal is to combine a richer information set that includes news with a state-of-the-art machine learning model. In particular, we leverage on two recent advances in Data Science, specifically on Word Embedding and Deep Learning models, which have recently attracted extensive attention in many scientific fields. We believe that by combining the two methodologies, effective solutions can be built to improve the prediction accuracy for economic and financial time series. In this preliminary contribution, we provide an overview of the methodology under development and some initial empirical findings. The forecasting model is based on DeepAR, an auto-regressive probabilistic Recurrent Neural Network model, that is combined with GloVe Word Embeddings extracted from economic news. The target variable is the spread between the US 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity and the 3-Month Treasury Constant Maturity (T10Y3M). The DeepAR model is trained on a large number of related GloVe Word Embedding time series, and employed to produce point and density forecasts.","tags":null,"title":"Exploring the Predictive Power of News and Neural Machine Learning Models for Economic Forecasting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Moreover, we study volatility spillovers among a large number of assets. To this end, we use penalized estimation of the VAR model with t-distributed errors.

Besides, these price, promotion and sales data are available not just for one store, but for a whole chain of stores. We propose to study cross‐category effects by using a multiclass VAR model: we jointly estimate cross‐category effects for several distinct but related VAR models, one for each store. Our methodology encourages effects to be similar across stores, while still allowing for small differences between stores to account for store heterogeneity. Moreover, our estimator is sparse: unimportant effects are estimated as exactly 0, which facilitates the interpretation of the results. A simulation study shows that the multiclass estimator proposed improves estimation accuracy by borrowing strength across classes. Finally, we provide three visual tools showing clustering of stores with similar cross‐category effects, networks of product categories and similarity matrices of shared cross‐category effects across stores.","tags":null,"title":"Multi-class vector autoregressive models for multi-store sales data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Barbaglia","Wilms","Croux"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1479164400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1479164400,"objectID":"b2caad83dec1d8e75c36b7cef7cc5a36","permalink":"https://lucabarbaglia.github.io/publication/2016_eneco_commodity_dynamics/","publishdate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_eneco_commodity_dynamics/","section":"publication","summary":"The correct understanding of commodity price dynamics can bring relevant improvements in terms of policy formulation both for developing and developed countries. Agricultural, metal and energy commodity prices might depend on each other: although we expect few important effects among the total number of possible ones, some price effects among different commodities might still be substantial. Moreover, the increasing integration of the world economy suggests that these effects should be comparable for different markets. This paper introduces a sparse estimator of the Multi-class Vector AutoRegressive model to detect common price effects between a large number of commodities, for different markets or investment portfolios. In a first application, we consider agricultural, metal and energy commodities for three different markets. We show a large prevalence of effects involving metal commodities in the Chinese and Indian markets, and the existence of asymmetric price effects. In a second application, we analyze commodity prices for five different investment portfolios, and highlight the existence of important effects from energy to agricultural commodities. The relevance of biofuels is hereby confirmed. Overall, we find stronger similarities in commodity price effects among portfolios than among markets.","tags":null,"title":"Commodity dynamics: A sparse multi-class approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
